# Java Exercises

## About
Java was the first language I began learning on my coding journey. As a refresher, I've decided to follow along with [Derek Banas' YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19).

I will update this repo as I follow along and refresh my knowledge on the language that made me fall in love with it all.
